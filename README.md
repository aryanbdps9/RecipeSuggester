# How to run
1. Make sure that you have the json files in `data` folder. It can be obtained by extracting `recipes_raw.zip`.
2. Make sure that `dumps` directory exists. (No need to remove its contents).
2. `cd` into scripts directory and run: `<python 3 name> parseIngredients.py`
    where `<python 3 name>` is the command used to run python 3. Usually it is `python3`, but if you are using **Anaconda**, then, it's simply `python`.
3. The script `parseIngredients.py` will generate `.json` files in `dumps` directory.

# Scripts
- `utils.py`: (utils -> short for utilities) Contains helper functions which can be used by many scripts.
- `parseIngredients.py`: This script separates quantities and items in `ingredients` field and stores into `sep_ingredients` field. (Look into the generated JSON files). 
- `extract.py`: Contains helper functions used by `parseIngredients.py`.
- `string_processing.py`: Contains functions related to string processing.
- `ingredient_dictionary.py`: Creates a dictionary from the dumps created by `parseIngredients.py`, which contains mapping between items and keys of recipes.
- `ingredient_dictionary_helper.py`: Helper functions used by `ingredients_dictionary.py`.
